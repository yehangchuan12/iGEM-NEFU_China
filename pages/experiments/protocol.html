                        <p>
                            1. Prepare an agarose gel and heat in a microwave for 2-4 minutes until the agarose is
                            dissolved; add
                            1/10000 concentration of Goldview mix thoroughly.<br>
                            2. Pour the gel onto a taped plate with casting combs in place. Allow 20-30 minutes for
                            solidification.<br>
                            3. Carefully remove the gel casting combs and place the gel in a horizontal
                            electrophoresis apparatus.
                            Add 1X TAE electrophoresis buffer to the reservoirs until the buffer covers the agarose
                            gel.<br>
                            4. Mix the agarose gel loading dye and DNA sample and load them into the wells.
                            Electrophorese the gel
                            at 150-200 mA until the required separation has been achieved, usually 0.5-1 hour.<br>
                            5. Visualize the electrophoresis results under UV light.</p>

                            and reuse the
                            collection tube.<br>

                            and reuse the
                            collection tube.<br>

                            8. Centrifuge the empty column for two minutes at maximum speed (15000 x g) to dry
                            the column
                            matrix. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.<br>
