							Pathway construction and optimization
						</h2>
						<h3>Overview:</h3>
						<h4>
							In order to obtain an engineered strain that could produce 7-methylxanthine (7-MX), we
							employed relevant
							genes in the
							NDM enzyme system of Pseudomonas CBB5.1 Three different plasmids were constructed (Fig. 1).
							The caffeine
							metabolic
							pathway was transformed into E. coli BW25113, enabling it to convert caffeine to 7-MX. We
							compared the
							yields of the
							three strains under the same induction conditions and evaluated the whole-cell biocatalysis
							conditions.
							Among them, the
							DtBA strain exhibited the highest yield of 7-MX production, which was 0.655 mM (Fig. 2).
						</h4>
						<h3>Details:</h3>
						<h4>
							In order to obtain an engineered strain that could produce 7-MX, we constructed three
							different plasmids
							using the
							relevant genes in the NDM enzyme system of Pseudomonas CBB5 (Fig. 1).1
							In the NDM enzyme system, NdmA and NdmB are Rieske [2Fe-2S] non-heme iron monooxygenases,
							and NdmD is a
							NADH-dependent
							reductase. The demethylation reaction relies on the reducing power provided by NdmD. We
							designed the ABD
							circuit based
							on the arrangement of these genes in the genome of the original species. However, the
							expression level
							of the ndmD was
							modest in the ABD strain. Therefore, we further constructed the DBA circuit and used the
							pBAD promoter
							to drive its
							expression. Next, we predicted that the N-terminal 266 amino acids of NdmD were likely
							dispensable to
							its function in
							our system, but exerted adverse pressure to cell growth.1 Therefore, we designed an NdmD’s
							truncated
							mutant DtBA to
							fulfil its activity.
						</h4>
						<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
						<h4>
							We individually transformed the three plasmids into E. coli BW25113, and compared their
							efficiencies in
							converting
							caffeine to 7-MX. We induced these three strains under the same conditions (30℃, 18 h, with
							0.2%
							arabinose and 1 mM
							IPTG), followed by the whole- cell catalysis (with 10 OD600 of bacteria and 1 mM caffeine as
							the
							substrate).
							High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was utilized to detect their yields of 7-MX
							production.
							Among them, the
							DtBA strain exhibited the highest yield, which was 0.655 mM of 7-MX (Fig. 2).

							Optimization of the synthesis process
						</h2>
						<h3>Overview:</h3>
						<h4>In the previous section, we constructed a relatively high yielding strain, DtBA. Then, we
							wanted to
							explore the optimal
							conditions for both protein expression and whole-cell biocatalysis using this strain.</h4>
						<h3>Details:</h3>
						<h4> Temperature (Fig. 3): when testing the condition of substrate concentration and bacterial
							density, the
							conversion rate
							of the induced strains could reach 100% at 25℃, 20℃ and 16℃, but it took longer time to
							produce the same
							amount of the
							recombinant proteins at 20℃ and 16℃ than that at 30℃.</h4>

							The whole-cell biocatalysis was implemented at 30℃, with 10 OD600 of bacteria and 1 mM

						</p>
						<h4>Substrate concentration and bacterial density: as the substrate concentration increased, up
							to 0.42
							g/L 7-MX could be
							generated by the conversion of 3 mM caffeine. At this point, we predicted that bacterial
							density
							increase could further
							improve the production. However, subsequent bacterial density increase did not further
							improve the
							yield, but instead
							resulted in a negative trajectory of 7-MX production (Fig. 4-2). At this juncture, we
							encountered a
							bottleneck to
							optimize the reaction.</h4>

						</p>
						<h4> Exploring the solution to break the reaction bottleneck:
							Caffeine demethylation is a reaction that consumes NADH and oxygen, and produces
							formaldehyde (Fig.
							5-1). Therefore, we
							predicted that this bottleneck could be possibly caused by insufficient NADH or
							formaldehyde’s toxicity
							to the host
							bacteria. With these conceptions in mind, we took the following approaches:
							① Initially, we conducted investigation to ascertain if the limitation in the reaction was
							attributed to
							the lack of
							NADH. Tween 20 can improve cell membrane permeability1 and thus may help the release of the
							by-product
							formaldehyde. The
							DtBA strain was utilized in the following experimental groups under four different
							conditions,
							including, (1) no
							addition, (2) addition of 0.2% Tween 20, (3) addition of 4 mM NADH, and (4) addition of both
							0.2% Tween
							20 and 4 mM
							NADH. As a result, the addition of Tween 20 and NADH could increase the reaction efficiency
							by 23.14%
							compared to the
							group with no addition (Figure 5-2). The results demonstrated that augmenting the
							concentration of NADH
							could indeed
							facilitate the reaction. However, it should be noted that increasing NADH alone did not show
							significant
							improvement.
							Consequently, it would be insufficient to only enhance the reducing power in order to
							achieve a
							substantial improvement
							of the conversion efficiency.
							② Formaldehyde is a highly reducing chemical that is soluble in water and can be oxidized by
							oxygen10.
							The increase of
							dissolved oxygen in the system would confer advantages in terms of formaldehyde reduction,
							and
							consequently facilitate
							the progression of the conversion. The DtBA strain was employed to establish three
							experimental groups
							with distinct
							amounts of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 5-3). The results from these three groups suggested that
							increased
							dissolved oxygen
							could significantly improve the yield, indicating that formaldehyde toxicity was an
							important factor
							leading to the
							reaction bottleneck.

						<h3>
							Overview:
						</h3>
						<h4>
							Our previous experiments provided us the verification that the formaldehyde, produced by the
							demethylation process of
							caffeine, significantly hampered the progression of the reaction. However, using just 1%
							volume of a
							flask or fermentor
							to reach sufficient oxygen supply and dilute the dissolved formaldehyde is clearly an
							inefficient
							approach and waste of
							space, which would be very difficult to scale up the fermentation system. Therefore, we
							attempted to
							employ
							manufacturing biology techniques to address the issue of formaldehyde, with the ultimate
							goal of
							developing a cofactor
							regeneration system.

							To verify the effect of formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, we carried out
							the
							following experiments:
						</h4>
						<h4>1. Knockout of the frmAB genes in the E. coli genome </h4>

						<h4>
							Gene knockout was achieved by the homologous recombination technology,3 and the detailed
							procedure can
							be found in our
							Notebook page. We prepared the BW/pKD46 electro-inductive strain and knocked out the frmAB
							genes in its
							genome to obtain
							the BW-Δfrm strain. ,ywas formed by us a clone the Afterwards, a well-isolated colony on a
							Kana/Amp
							double-antibiotics
							plate was picked after colony PCR screening. We confirmed that the genomic frmAB genes were
							successfully
							knocked out
							(Fig. 7-1). Then, the picked BW-Δfrm colony was cultured in the Kana/Amp double-antibiotics
							plates at
							37℃ for 12 h. No
							colony was formed on this plate (Fig. 6), indicating that the colony acquired by us was not
							a
							contaminated clone by the
							original BW/Pkd46 competent bacteria.
							The whole-cell biocatalysis of the BW-Δfrm strain was conducted. Under the same conditions,
							the yield of
							knockout strain
							was about 17% lower than that of the original strain (Fig. 8). Therefore, we confirmed that
							the
							endogenous frmAB enzymes
							produced by the E. coli genome could promote the reaction of formaldehyde dehydrogenation,
							but their
							expression levels
							were far from the need of our system.

						<h4>
							2. Verification of the effect of formaldehyde dehydrogenase or and formate dehydrogenase in
							the knockout
							strain BW-Δfrm.
						</h4>

						<h4>We constructed three low-copy plasmids containing frmAB, FDH or both frmAB and FDH genes.
							These plasmids
							were transformed into the BW-Δfrm/DtBA and BW/DtBA strains. Experimental details can be
							found in our
							Protocol page. These three strains were analyzed by the whole-cell biocatalysis under the
							optimized
							conditions obtained from previous experiments. </h4>
						<h4>
							According to the experimental results in Fig. 8, the frmAB knockout strain showed a 7-MX
							yield similar
							to the original
							one. If the sum of 7-MX and theobromine yield was put together as the caffeine metabolism
							yield, the
							caffeine metabolism
							capacity of the original strain was 25.17% stronger than that of the knockout strain. These
							data
							suggested that
							endogenous FfrmAB of <i>E. coli</i> has genuine. The addition of FDH alone showed no
							practical effect on
							the yield increase, while the impact of additional frmAB was more significant.
							the yield
							of the strain containing both exogenous frmAB and FDH exhibited a substantial increase
							.
						</h4>
						<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
						<h4>The strain containing both exogenous frmAB and FDH expression plasmids showed the best
							results
							(Table. 1). It could provide NADH for the reaction to convert the toxic by-product
							formaldehyde to
							carbon dioxide,
							leading to improved conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the addition of our cofactor
							regeneration system
							produced 1.33
							g/L of 7-MX, which was 260.36% increase of the yield versus the condition of no addition.

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<h4>By expanding fermentation, we successfully increased the yield of 7-MX to approximately

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<h4>We found that coffee residues could be used as an excellent source of caffeine. According to
							statistics,
							caffeine
							accounts for up to 1.8% of the dry weight in coffee residues.5 As the coffee market
							continues expanding,
							the annual
							output of coffee residues has reached as high as 6 million tons.6 (For more sustainable
							exhibition
							contents, please
							visit our Human Practice page.) We collected some coffee grounds locally, and tested their
							conversion to
							7-MX.</h4>
						<h3>Detail</h3>
						<h4>We obtained some free coffee grounds from several local coffee stores, and their contents of
							caffeine
							were examined by
							HPLC after drying. However, the caffeine content measured by us in these materials was less
							than the
							theoretical 1.8%
							(Fig. 13), which might be attributed to our inefficient drying process. Nevertheless, we
							were still
							convinced that
							abundant caffeine was present in the coffee residues.</h4>
						<h4>We resuspended the dried coffee residues as a 50 g/L mix and conducted HPLC test after
							filtering the
							insoluble
							substance. The result showed that their caffeine content of the liquid phase was 1.85 mM. We
							converted
							the caffeine in
							the liquid portion using our engineered bacteria and obtained 1.84 mM 7-MX with a conversion
							rate of
							99.46% (Fig. 14).</h4>
						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<h4>In this section, we successfully verified the feasibility of utilizing the low-cost
							substrate, caffeine
							from the coffee
							residues, to produce 7-MX.</h4>

						<h2 id="6">Final conclusion</h2>
						<h4>Clinical trials indicate that 7-MX has the ability to slow down myopia, but the high cost of
							production
							restricts its
							application for further research. Through the optimization of gene circuit, cultivation
							process and
							fermentation, we
							achieved highly efficient biological production of 7-MX and eliminated the generation of the
							toxic
							by-product
							formaldehyde, which could promote large-scale 7-MX production. Meanwhile, we provided a new
							strategy of
							decaffeinating
							coffee grounds that has an annual output of over 6 million tons, and promoted their
							secondary
							utilization.</h4>
