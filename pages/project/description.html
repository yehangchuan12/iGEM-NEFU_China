                        Inspiration
                    </h2>
                    <h4>
                        Our team members possess diverse perspectives and viewpoints in synthetic biology. Nevertheless,
                        it is
                        our ultimate consensus that we fervently aspire to draw inspiration from our quotidian
                        experiences in
                        order to formulate a project that can effectively improve the overall standard of life. Frequent
                        gatherings are held to engage in collaborative ideation sessions aiming at devising strategies
                        to
                        address practical challenges through the application of synthetic biology. With careful
                        examination, we
                        realized that a large portion of our team members are currently afflicted with myopia.
                        Subsequently, by
                        means of systematic observation, conducting interviews, and consulting relevant reports, we
                        concluded
                        that the prevalence of myopia was experiencing a notable surge within the general population. In
                        our
                        analysis of café statistics, a significant proportion of consumers exhibited varying degrees of
                        myopia.
                        In order to elucidate this occurrence, it is postulated that certain individuals consume coffee
                        as a
                        means to enhance their cognitive focus and sustain wakefulness to work on tasks requiring
                        heightened
                        attention, such as manuscript writing and computing programming, which can promote formation of
                        myopia.
                        Nevertheless, the current myopia treatment have numerous limitations. Therefore, our objective
                        is to
                        develop a secure and dependable strategy with the potential for long-term utilization, to
                        fundamentally
                        alleviate the development of myopia. </h4>

                        Background

                    <h4>
                        Myopia is recognized as one of the three prominent global disorders. Currently, the global
                        prevalence of
                        myopia is at approximately 30%.1 The prevalence of myopia in China is estimated to be over 400
                        million
                        individuals, with teens accounting for about 270 million of this population.2 In 2015, the
                        global
                        economic cost resulted from unaddressed myopia and vision impairment caused by myopic macular
                        degeneration was estimated to be a staggering $244 billion.3 According to the forecast, the
                        global
                        population of individuals afflicted with myopia will escalate to five billion in 2050 year,
                        leading to
                        an exacerbation of health-related complications and a consequential amplification of economic
                        burdens.4

                        Myopia is caused by elongation of the axis-oculi and reduction in lens’ focal length, resulting
                        in an
                        elongated or egg-shaped eyeball. The progression of myopia has the potential to result in
                        several ocular
                        complications, including cataract, glaucoma and irreversible visual impairment.5

                        7-methylxanthine (7-MX), a natural metabolite of caffeine, is a novel and ideal drug suitable
                        for
                        long-term oral administration by people of all ages to alleviate myopia development. It is a
                        non-selective adenosine antagonist that causes scleral thickening and increases the diameter of
                        the
                        scleral collagen fibers. These effects are in contrast to the reported changes in myopic eyes.
                        Moreover,
                        7-MX exhibits negligible toxicity, absence of allergenic effects, blood-brain permeability, and
                        decent
                        efficacy. When taken orally, it can satisfy nearly all optimal drug criteria for the treatment
                        of
                        progressive myopia.6,7

                        Currently, we still lack effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of myopia. The
                        existing
                        remedies like glasses can improve visual acuity by rectifying refractive errors, but they cannot
                        address
                        the underlying pathological mechanisms, which cause continual elongation of the axis-oculi and
                        progression of myopia. Similarly, the existing myopic surgery and eye drops have the potential
                        of
                        heightening visual impairment and, to some extent, increasing the risk of myopia relapse.10
                        These
                        traditional approaches for myopia adjustment, like glasses and contact lenses, cannot provide
                        secure and
                        effective alleviation over the long term.</h4>

                        pathway of 7-MX exhibits limited productivity and entails significant costs. Furthermore, during

                        Solution
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        To effectively prevent the generation and progression of myopia, we designed a treatment named
                        "Opticafé", utilizing 7-MX derived from economical coffee residues.

                        Compared to the traditional de novo biosynthesis route, Opticafé constructs a cofactor
                        regeneration
                        system in engineered cells. With this ingenious system, it becomes possible to not only address
                        the
                        deficiency of NADH, but also eliminate the pollution of the byproduct formaldehyde.

                        By concurrently adjusting gene expression, we are able to effectively enhance both the yield and
                        purity
                        of 7-MX. This approach overcomes the constraints associated with low yields and purity of the
                        manufacture of 7-MX in yeast from scratch. The safe alleviation of myopia across all age groups
                        can be
                        potentially achieved by incorporating the synthetic 7-MX into coffee products or pharmaceutical
                        formulations. This approach mitigates the possible hazards associated with the development of
                        severe
                        myopia. Moreover, the coffee residues obtained from the extraction process can be effectively
                        repurposed
                        as livestock feed, maximizing the utilization of the residual nutrients and mitigating any
                        potential
                        adverse environmental consequences associated with these residues.

                        Opticafé provides a solution for people who are suffering from myopia and eye diseases caused by
                        axis-oculi elongation. This approach presents a novel method to mitigate myopia, while
                        simultaneously
                        optimize 7-MX production and promote environmental sustainability through material recycling.
                        The
                        multiple reuses of coffee grounds, which are caffeine-rich waste, solve the problem of limited
                        production of 7-MX biosynthesis from scratch. 7-MX transformed from caffeine can alleviate the
                        emergence
                        and development of myopia. The incorporation of a cofactor regeneration system serves to
                        eliminate the
                        detrimental effects of the byproduct formaldehyde on environment, the human body and E. coli

                        approach can efficiently circumvent the potential environmental pollution caused by coffee
                        grounds.
                        Furthermore, the utilization of processed coffee grounds as livestock feed offers the
