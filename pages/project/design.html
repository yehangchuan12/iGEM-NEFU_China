                    <h2 id="1">Overview</h2>
                    <p>A modular platform was designed and developed to optimize the synthesis of 7-methylxanthine
                        (7-MX), a compound
                        known for its potential to alleviate myopia, utilizing caffeine as the substrate.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays, the significant cost of 7-MX is mainly ascribed to the following two reasons. One
                        primary reason
                        pertains to the difficulty associated with chemical synthesis, including the low yield, high
                        expense and
                        considerable by-product pollutants. The second reason is that de novo synthesis of 7-MX in yeast
                        is difficult
                        and inefficient. The current caffeine degradation technique exhibits a maximum yield of only
                        0.37g/L.1 We
                        optimized this platform through a rational design by retrieving caffeine from coffee residues.
                        This optimization
                        reduces the costs and enables the effective decaffeination of coffee residues. With
                        substantially reduced
                        caffeine content, the generated grounds can be reused for other purposes or safely disposed. All
                        above is
                        realized through the following two modules:</p>
                    <p>In Module 1, we constructed a high-copy plasmid expressing caffeine degradation genes. This
                        plasmid was
                        subsequently introduced into the BW25113 strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in order to
                        facilitate the
                        demethylation of caffeine and subsequently produce 7-MX.</p>
                    <p>In Module 2, a low-copy plasmid containing the genes for formaldehyde dehydrogenation was
                        constructed and also
                        transformed into the BW25113 strain. In this case, we successfully eliminated formaldehyde that
                        is generated as
                        a by-product during the demethylation of caffeine to produce 7-MX. Formaldehyde is not only
                        toxic to our
                        engineered bacterial hosts, but also harmful to the environment. Besides, this system can also
                        provide NADH as
                        the reducing power to the demethylation reaction. </p>
                    <p>This section outlines the process of designing the two modules, verifying their functions, and
                        optimizing the
                        strategy.</p>

                        7-MX
                    </h2>
                    <p>7-MX: the first reported methylxanthine compound that alleviates myopia</p>
                    <p>Methylxanthine compounds mainly come from natural plants, such as Guarana-related products2,
                        coffee, tea and
                        various herbal medicines3. They contain a variety of methylxanthine and polyphenols, in which
                        the most common
                        methylxanthines are caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine) and
                        theophylline
                        (1,3-domethylxanthine). In addition, many kinds of methylxanthines contain only one methyl
                        group. In the early
                        study of deprivation myopia in guinea pigs, 7-MX could eliminate eyeball elongation caused by
                        morphological
                        deprivation4. Another report also demonstrated 7-MX’s beneficial effects on deprivation myopia
                        in rabbits 5
                        (Fig. 1), which suggested that 7-MX could be potentially used as a drug in the treatment of

                    <h3>Gene source</h3>
                    <p>Caffeine degradation genes mainly come from Pseudomonas. Multiple caffeine degradation
                        pathways
                        exist, but a
                        unique one is present in Pseudomonas CBB5, which demethylates caffeine (Fig. 3).7 We chose
                        to
                        use the genes in
                        the CBB5 genome and planned to express NdmA and NdmD in engineered E. coli BW25113. Through
                        this
                        pathway,
                        caffeine can be converted to theobromine, which is then converted to 7-MX by NdmB and NdmD
                        (Fig.

                    <h3>Production and Construction Design of 7-MX</h3>
                    <p>We were originally inspired by the sequence of the Ndm genes in the CBB5 genome (Fig. 5).8
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-container" style="width: 15%;margin: 0 0 0 5%;">

                    <p><b>Fig. 5.</b>Pseudomonas putida CBB5 contains the ndmA, ndmB and ndmD gene cluster.8</p>
                    <p>We constructed a plasmid containing the ABD circuit with an order of ndmA, ndmB, ndmD driven
                        by
                        the common
                        promoter pBAD (Fig. 6-1), but the 7-MX production by the ABD strain was very low. After our
                        rational analysis,
                        we found that the activities of both NdmA and NdmB require the participation of NdmD, and
                        thus
                        deduced that the
                        order of importance of the genes in 7-MX production could likely be ndmD>ndmB>ndmA (please
                        read
                        the Engineering
                        page for more details). Therefore, we constructed a plasmid with the DBA circuit, in which
                        ndmD
                        is located
                        downstream of a strong promoter, pBAD, and ndmB and ndmA are driven by the promoter p107
                        with

                        the plasmid in Fig. 6-1.</p>
                    <p>The high molecular weight of NdmD could be the reason for the low expression of ndmD as an
                        exogenous protein. We
                        hoped to improve the yield and solubility of the ndmD protein by optimizing its sequence. We
                        noted that ndmD
                        contains a Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster at the N-terminal, which allows NdmC and NdmE to form a
                        tight
                        NdmCDE complex;
                        however, this part of the sequence is unnecessary in promoting NdmA and NdmB activities.9 In
                        order to reduce
                        metabolic pressure and increase the expression of ndmD, we removed the first 266 amino acid
                        residues of NdmD to
                        form a truncated protein, ndmDt (for more details, please visit the Parts page). The NdmDt
                        protein size is only
                        54.7% of the full-length NdmD. We put a strong promoter (pBAD) upstream of the ndmDt, and a
                        moderately strong
                        promoter (p107) upstream of the ndmB and ndmA to construct the DtBA circuit (Fig. 7). After
                        comparing these
                        three circuits with different utilizations of promoters, we ultimately selected arabinose to
                        induce ndmDt
                        expression and IPTG to induce ndmBA expression. The highly increased yield of 7-MX was
                        further
                        realized through
                        this optimization (Fig. 8)</p>

                    <h2 id="5">Module 2: Construction of the cofactor regeneration system</h2>
                    <p>We had learned that in the process of caffeine demethylation to produce 7-MX, NADH is used
                        and
                        formaldehyde is
                        released, the latter of which is highly harmful to the human body and may pollute the
                        environment.10 In
                        addition, formaldehyde also has severe toxicity in the engineered E. coli cells,11 which may
                        lead to early cell
                        death and reduce the transformation efficiency. Therefore, we decided to design a cofactor
                        regeneration system
                        based on formaldehyde dehydrogenase to eliminate formaldehyde produced in the demethylation
                        process and provide
                        NADH for the reaction.</p>
                    <h3>frmAB knockout in the E. coli genome</h3>
                    <p>In the E. coli genome, the formaldehyde dehydrogenase frmA and frmB can convert formaldehyde
                        to
                        formic acid.12
                        Therefore, we first wanted to verify whether the expression of frmAB in the original genome
                        could be sufficient
                        to dehydrogenate the formaldehyde produced by caffeine demethylation. Using the homologous
                        recombination method,
                        a common approach used in our laboratory, we knocked out the frmAB genes in the E. coli
                        genome
                        to get the
                        BW2-Δfrm strain. Subsequently, we compared the production levels of the wild type and
                        BW2-Δfrm
                        strains, which
                        could indirectly assess the adequacy of endogenously expressed frmAB in eliminating
                        formaldehyde
                        in Module 1
                        (Fig. 9).</p>

                        recombination method to replace, the frmAB in the genome was replaced by the resistance gene
                        kana. Meanwhile.
                        the frmAB gene was transferred into the DtBA plasmid shown in Fig. 6-3. The effect of the
                        endogenous frmAB is
                        indirectly verified by comparing the yield of the two strains.</p>
                    <h3 id=>Verification of formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase</h3>
                    <p>We transformed the low-copy plasmids with frmAB, FDH, or both into the BW25113- Δ frm strain
                        together with DtBA
                        (Fig. 10). We hypothesized that formate dehydrogenase FDH alone had minimal effect on the
                        reaction, and it was
                        necessary to cooperate with FrmAB to augment the effect. Eventually, we found that the
                        strains
                        with the genomic
                        frmAB, exogenously introduced frmAB and FDH could achieve the maximum 7-MX production

                    <p>How to test? </p>
                    <p>We have learned that formaldehyde causes toxicity to E. coli cells and leads to a decrease in
                        production yield.
                        Thus, we used an indirect approach to test the effect of each enzyme on the reaction through
                        examining the 7-MX
                        yields of these strains under different conditions by HPLC, as shown in Fig. 9.</p>

                    <h2 id="6">Two-module interaction system</h2>
                    <p>We hoped to utilize Module 1 for the degradation of caffeine to produce 7-MX, while Module 2
                        would be used to
                        eliminate the formaldehyde formed in Module 1. Additionally, Module 2 could produce NADH,
                        which
                        would be fed
                        back into Module 1 to enhance the forward reaction. This approach aimed to establish a
                        sustainable and efficient
