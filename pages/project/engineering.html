                    <p>Our team achieved efficient and low-cost production of 7-methylxanthine (7-MX) through building a
                        caffeine
                        metabolism platform in E. coli. Meanwhile, by constructing a cofactor cycle, we released the
                        reducing power in
                        the 7-MX manufacturing system, which fits our goal of environment-friendly production.</p>

                    <h2 id="2">Cycle 1: construction of a gene pathway according to their arrangement in the CBB5 genome
                    </h2>
                    <h3>design</h3>
                    <p>In Pseudomonas putida CBB5, NdmA and NdmB are independent Rieske nonheme iron monooxygenases with
                        N-1 and N-3
                        specific N-demethylation activities, respectively. Their activity depends on the oxidation of
                        NADH by NdmD to
                        provide electrons and catalyze the N-demethylation reaction1. Therefore, we decided to construct
                        a gene pathway
                        following their gene locus arrangement in the CBB5 genome. Next, we transformed the created
                        plasmid into E. coli
                        to test the function of NdmA, B and D, aiming to achieve the goal of converting caffeine to
                        7-MX.</p>
                    <h3>Build</h3>
                    <p>We synthesized the ndmA, B and D genes, and obtained their coding sequences by PCR. Then, we
                        ligated them
                        downstream of the pBAD promoter in the expression vector using the Golden Gate assembly method.
                        After the
                        successful construction, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BW25113, and the strain ABD
                        was obtained.</p>

                    <h3>Learn</h3>
                    <p>The production of the trace amounts of 7-MX and theobromine by the ABD clone conceptually proved
                        that the ndmA, B
                        and D genes were all expressed and functional in our constructed plasmids. The extremely low
                        yield of the
                        products could be due to the insufficient expression of NdmD. Inadequate supply of NdmD could
                        have led to
                        suppressing NdmA and NdmB activities. In the meantime, the results showed that the intermediate
                        product
                        theobromine has obvious accumulation relative to 7-MX. We predicted that the expression of NdmB
                        was
                        insufficient, which hindered the conversion of theobromine to 7-MX. Therefore, we intended to
                        improve the
                        expression of these key genes by altering the arrangement sequence of the ndmA, B and D genes in

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>Among the NdmA, B and D, NdmD is a highly specific reductase for the Ndm enzymes and provides the
                        major power for
                        the reaction1. Both NdmA and NdmB are virtually dependent on NdmD for their proper functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the caffeine breakdown pathway, the enzyme NdmA initiates the process by catalyzing the
                        removal of the
                        N1-methyl group from caffeine, resulting in the formation of theobromine. Next, the enzyme NdmB
                        utilizes
                        theobromine as a substrate and facilitates the removal of the N3-methyl group, leading to the
                        production of
                        7-MX. To enhance the expression of the crucial ndmD gene and improve the catalytic efficiency of
                        NdmB in
                        converting theobromine to 7-MX, we modified the gene arrangement to the order of DBA.</p>

                    <p>The NdmD coding sequence was placed in the first place, driven by the strong pBAD promoter. After
                        adjusting the
                        sequential order of the ndmA and ndmB coding sequences, the Lac operon and the medium-strong
                        promoter p107 were
                        used to activate the expression of the ndmB and ndmA genes, which are all assembled into a
                        vector using the
                        Golden Gate method. The generated plasmid was transformed into E. coli BW25113 to obtain the
                        strain DBA.</p>

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>After analyzing previous literature, we found that both the N-terminal Rieske type 2Fe-2S domain
                        and the
                        interdomain sequences are dispensable for electron transfer of NADH. The removal of this
                        sequence from the
                        N-terminal region of NdmD will unlikely impact its enzymatic activity and thermal stability2.
                        Therefore, we
                        planned to truncate this key gene by removing the redundant N-terminal and interdomain sequence,
                        which may
                        reduce the metabolic pressure of E. coli and subsequently increase the solubility of NdmD,
                        leading to further
                        increased 7-MX production.</p>

                        the coding region of the excess 266 amino acids at the N-terminus. The PCR fragment was ligated
                        together with
                        the ndmB and ndmA coding sequences into a vector using the Golden Gate assembly. The generated

                    <p>NdmA and NdmB release methyl groups from the N-1 and N-3 sites of caffeine molecules,
                        respectively, which are
                        usually further oxidized to formaldehyde by oxygen3. The generated formaldehyde can be highly
                        toxic to both the
                        engineered bacteria and the environment. Thus, we decided to set up a cofactor regeneration

                                    team provides a DNA assembly strategy, which standardizes and
                                    modularizes the DNA assembly process enough, with high positive rate, so
                                    that the strategy can be fully adapted to single and repeated mechanical
                                    operations, and take advantage of mechanization to achieve the assembly
                                    of a large number of DNA fragments in a short time.
